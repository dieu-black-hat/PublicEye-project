Project Overview
Public Eye is an online crime reporting system designed to streamline the process of reporting crimes, tracking case progress, and ensuring transparent communication between the public and law enforcement agencies. The system enables users to report crimes from anywhere, track their reports using a unique case ID, and provide feedback or additional information. It also facilitates secure access for law enforcement officers and administrators to manage cases efficiently.
